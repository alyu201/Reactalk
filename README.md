<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## üìã Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

#### Software
1. [Node v14.0](https://nodejs.org/en/) or above
```sh
npm install npm@latest -g

# check for node version >14
node --version
```
2. [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
3. [SoX v14.4.1](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sox) (for Windows users)

#### Services
1. Setup a Google Cloud project by following the steps outlined [here](https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text/docs/before-you-begin) (Note: this will require a billing account for the Google Cloud service). Store the google credentials file for the Google Cloud project somewhere safely

#### Hardware
1. Desktop USB microphone (recommended)
2. Laptop/PC

### Setup and run Reactalk for development

1. Clone the repository to your local machine

```sh
 git clone https://github.com/alyu201/Reactalk.git
```
2. Set the Google Cloud project credentials as an environment variable
  - Windows:
    - Add the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` env variable with the path to the credential keys json file as the value using the `env` field in the `launch.json` file in the `.vscode` folder.

  - Mac:
    - When setting up the environment variables for Mac, it is better to set the environment varaible in the shell startup file (for example in the `~/.bashrc` or `~/.profile` file) so that the variable can be applied in future shell sessions.

3. Ensure you are at the root directory
4. Run `npm install` on your terminal to install the required node dependencies.
```sh
npm install
```
5. Due to issues with `node-record-lpcm16` package, the `index.js` file of the package needs updating. Go to `node_modules/node-record-lpcm16/recorders/index.js` and on line 5, change the `return require(...)` to return `require(`./${recorderName}`)` instead

6. Build and start the extension in an Extension Development Host window by pressing the `F5 key`
